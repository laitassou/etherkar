                Etherkar is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Smart Contract”) 
                to enable users to travel together and share fees.
                 interact with (the “Site”). The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “App”.
                  Using the App, users can publish theri travels and propose carpooling services.

1. Our service
<li>
A. We have utilized Smart Contracts to develop our service, and these smart contracts rule the usage to offer a fiable and fair service.
</li>

<li>
B. As travel publisher, you create travel and give details about your travel. User who are interested can reserve  
</li>

</ul>

<ul>
2. The App
<li>
A. To most easily use the App, you must first install the Google Chrome web browser. 
Once you have installed Chrome, you will need to install a browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is an electronic wallet, 
which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. 
<br />
You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask (or other Ethereum-compatible browsers). The App will only recognize you as a user, and you will only be able to interact with the App, if your Ethereum electronic wallet is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask account. 
There is no other way to sign up as a user, or to interact directly with the App.
</li>
<li>
B. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.
</li>
<li>
C. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. 
<br /> 
We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.
</li>
<li>
D. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update as necessary your account information. You are responsible for the security of your account and your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets and accounts). If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at meow@Etherkar.co.
</li>

</ul>
<ul>
3. Fees and Payment

<li>
A. If you elect to reserve ride via Etherkar on the App, or with or from other users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via  MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or MetaMask.
</li>
<li>
B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.
</li>
<li>
C. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a reservation with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of 5% of the price of that transaction (each, a “Commission”). You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network as part of your payment. 
</li>
<li>
D. As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, or breeding of any of your Etherkar). Except for income taxes levied on EtherLabs, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.

8. Assumption of Risk

You accept and acknowledge each of the following:
<li>
A. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile.

We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Etherkar will not lose money.
</li>
<li>
B. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Etherkar-related transactions. EtherLabs is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.
</li>
<li>
C. The App does not store, send, or receive Etherkar. This is because Etherkar exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of Etherkar occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not on the App.
</li>
<li>
D. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that EtherLabs will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.
</li>
<li>
E. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Etherkar ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Etherkar.
</li>
<li>
F. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Etherkar ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Etherkar.
</li>
<li>
G. Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC-20 standard, including the Etherkar ecosystem.
</li>
